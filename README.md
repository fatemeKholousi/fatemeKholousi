### Hi EveryOne ðŸ‘‹
I'm Fateme , a Front End developer . I started learning JS at late 2020 when I had no Idea how big JS world is. I watched several courses and get bored so if I'm supposed to get bored while watching course why not reading document and article?so after all I decided get along with reading docs these days. 
- I also love reading old books , mangas , listening to KPOP and JPOP and watching Anime . I use these topics to my practices which you might find out after take a look at my repositories.
