### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Fateme, you can call me Fatte-master on SNS
#### currently I am a junior Front-End developer


 I started learning JS at late 2020 when I had no Idea how big JS world is.
 Recently I figured out "JS is my Ninja way"! (as Naruto said) so I believe in teamwork and not giving up.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS / TS(although I'm not a fan!)
